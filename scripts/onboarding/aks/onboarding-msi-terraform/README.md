If you are deploying a new AKS cluster using Terraform with ama logs addon enabled, follow the steps below.

1. Please download all files under https://aka.ms/enable-monitoring-msi-terraform.
2. Update variables.tf to replace values in "<>".
3. Run `terraform init -upgrade` to initialize the Terraform deployment.
4. Run `terraform plan -out main.tfplan` to initialize the Terraform deployment.
5. Run `terraform apply main.tfplan` to apply the execution plan to your cloud infrastructure.

**NOTE**
- Please edit the main.tf file appropriately before running the terraform template
- Data will start flowing after 10 minutes since the cluster needs to be ready first
- Workspace ID needs to match format '/subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/example-resource-group/providers/Khulnasoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/workspaceValue'
- If resource group already exists, please run `terraform import azurerm_resource_group.rg /subscriptions/<Subscription_ID>/resourceGroups/<Resource_Group_Name>` before terraform plan
